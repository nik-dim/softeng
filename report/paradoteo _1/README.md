only `.tex` files are uploaded.

## Intro

The exercise is split into 3 parts (one for each stakeholder):

- users
- administrators
- gas station owners

## How to compile

Each stakeholder has a folder with .tex files. Each file corresponds to a requirement.

### How to compile?

1. download folder

2. there are 4 .tex files in the current directory:

   - administrators.tex
   - users.tex
   - gas_stations.tex
   - paradoteo_1.tex (all the above merged in one)

   open one of these and compile it. That's it!

To make changes open a req{}.tex file in the respective folder and make appropriate modifications. Then, to see the changes, compile the respective file (see step 2)
